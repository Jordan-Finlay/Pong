# UX

I've created a game of Pong.
Pong was created back in the 29th of November 1972.
This is my first Javascript project I've made and wanted to make Pong as a credit for my dad. We used to play it a lot when I was young and built our own Pong game years ago.
The game is simple but fun.
I created it for users to jump in and out easily and solely to enjoy themself with this amazing classic game.
I kept the design simple with a basic background with no images to distract the user and keep them engaged with the game, aswell as keeping the original colors for the canvas and ball. I changed and updated the paddles for a more modern classic of red vs blue.
I created a "start menu" so the user isn't rushed into the game and can read the rules fairly before starting. Even when starting the game I've implemented a time delay for two and a half seconds before the ball starts moving to again not rush the user.
Theres a scoreboard to keep track of the score aswell as a reset button if the user would like to start from the top.

# Features

__Existing Features__

- A fully functioning and correctly working game of Pong.
- A basic background with no images to distract the user.
- A classic black canvas with a white ball - as a nod to the classic Atari Pong.

- A start menu before starting the game to give the user time to read the rules. I thought this would be a great way for the user not to be rushed into forcing playing the game without knowing the controls and would ultimately lead to a bad user experience. The game runs at the users pace and they're allowed to start when ready.

<br />

- A timer delay after clicking start. For two and a half seconds when entering the game the ball is frozen and will not move - just to allow the user to brace themselves before beginning.
